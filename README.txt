RELEVANT USER FEEDBACK:
	- The scores are difficult to see on the toolbar. Better contrast may be helpful.
	- The temples are in alphabetical order, an obvious update would be to place them out of order.

It was really helpful for me to get a chance to talk this over with a real user. It was genuinely interesting to see someone who had no idea what the "backend" of the app looked like to poke and prod at it to see what they thought. Some of their ideas were obvious or simply a lack of understanding on their part, but other ideas (such as the difficulty of seeing the scores) were things I hadn't noticed.

MEANINGFUL TEMPLES (both happen to already be included):
	- Columbus Ohio: This was the temple for my mission. It was actually really interesting for me, because I never was able to attend that temple since it was outside of mission boundaries. However, the influence of the temple on the members were clear. The commitment they showed just to attend the temple, even several times a week (2+ hour drive), left a lasting impression on me. 

	- Draper, UT: This temple is the closest to my home, and one of the most beautiful (in my humble opinion) in the church. I have had the opportunity to attend several times, and it has been a real treat to serve there.

SIDE NOTE:
	This project definitely looks best on the 6+ screens. While I've tested it on the others, this is the easiest to navigate.
